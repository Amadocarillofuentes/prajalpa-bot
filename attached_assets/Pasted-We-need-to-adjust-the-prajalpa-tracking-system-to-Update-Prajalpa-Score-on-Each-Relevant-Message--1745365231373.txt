We need to adjust the prajalpa tracking system to:

Update Prajalpa Score on Each Relevant Message:

The bot should check if the message contains prajalpa-related keywords (e.g., “Govind,” “Radhe Radhe,” etc.).

The prajalpa score should increase or decrease based on the type of message (positive or negative).

Allow the prajalpa score to go negative with no limit.

Message History:

The bot should store all prajalpa-related messages with timestamps in message_history.

Each user should have a message_history array that records all their prajalpa-related messages.

Send Warning on High Prajalpa Score:

If a user's prajalpa score exceeds 50, a message should be sent in the channel notifying the user to take a break.

No message should be sent after each "good" message (i.e., related to prajalpa), only when prajalpa exceeds the threshold of 50.

Ensure Data is Saved Correctly:

Use JSON to store user data (prajalpa score, message history, last updated timestamp).

Make sure data is updated and saved with every relevant message.

Additional Notes:

There should be no limit on negative prajalpa.

Ensure the score decreases appropriately (e.g., when Lord Krishna’s name is mentioned in a positive, devotional way).

After each prajalpa-related message, the bot should update the prajalpa score, and the message_history array should store all prajalpa-related messages.

Code Example to Implement:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Check message content and adjust prajalpa score
if (isPrajalpaMessage(message)) {
    const userId = message.author.id;
    let userData = data[userId] || { prajalpa_score: 0, message_history: [], last_updated: new Date().toISOString() };
    
    // Increment prajalpa score by 1 for each prajalpa-related message
    userData.prajalpa_score += 1;  // Can also use `-= 1` to decrease score based on context

    // Allow prajalpa score to go negative without limit
    // If you want to allow it to go indefinitely negative, don't set a minimum value.

    // Save the new prajalpa score and message
    userData.message_history.push({ message: message.content, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });

    // Update the last_updated timestamp
    userData.last_updated = new Date().toISOString();

    // Save to data.json
    data[userId] = userData;

    // Send a response if prajalpa score is too high (threshold set to 50)
    if (userData.prajalpa_score > 50) {
        message.channel.send(`<@${userId}>, your prajalpa score is getting too high! Please take a break.`);
    }
}
Key Updates:
Threshold of 50: The bot will only send a warning when the prajalpa score exceeds 50.

No Message on "Good" Messages: No bot reply after good prajalpa messages, only after crossing the prajalpa threshold (50).
